I really enjoy organizing and participating in events like MUN, therefore I am very proud to be a member of the Secretariat. What is the most exciting about GDNMUN is the possibility of exchanging contradictory opinions. I strongly believe that taking part in such discussions is a splendid way of broadening one's intellectual horizons. I hope the debates will be a unique experience for all of us.

                                 The name that was given me at the baptise is Thomas (actually it was Tomasz but who would bother to pronounce all that swish ‘sh’?). I’m thrilled to call myself a Crisis Director (sometimes referred to as The Lord of Chaos) at the Gdansk MUN 2017! I can assure you that your Crisis experience will not fade away quickly. You can look forward to rumbustious negotiations, emotional talks, strong leadership and a lot of planning schemes. Take your briefcases, pens and nerves of steel and prepare for the vibrant dispute!

                                Honourable Delegates, My name is Tosia and I am also a student of IB Diploma Programme in III High School in Gdansk. I enjoy planning and organising events and I hope you will remember this MUN as a valuable experience worth repeating. Should you have any questions either right now or later at the event itself do not hesitate to contact me or talk to me.

                                My name is Zuzanna, and soon, hopefully, I will become an International Baccalaureate student in High School no 3 in Gdansk. Being a part of GDNMUN’s Secretariat is not only an outstanding opportunity but also an ideal entry to my future education. I’ve always put a great interest in international affairs, and that’s one of the reasons for which I became an exchange student and attended high school in United States of America for 10 months. I would like to underline how much we appreciate attendees from all over the world and their contribution to our conference’s quality, and give all of you a warm welcome to GDNMUN!
